This web application allows user to search their favorite food over 1,000,000 recipes and to select their interested recipe from 30 results which they will get from an external web API Food2Fork. â€¢ Java Script (ES6+), AJAX, Webpack Dev server, HTML5 and CSS3 are used in order to develop above web application which will facilitate a nice user experience.


In order to start this projetc fisr install node and npm. Then install all the dependencies which are present in package.json file.
Then create webpack.js file and babel.rc file.

SRC folder contains files for each individual task like models(_____.js files) folder, view(____View.js files) folder and controller(index.js file), index.html and style.css file.

While WEBPACK folder contains the single js file called bundle.js(which is bundeled from all the js files in src folder by webpack), index.html and style.css file. 

npm run start command can be used in cmd prompt to run thisapplication.

or simply

Index.html file in webpack folder can be used to run this application.
